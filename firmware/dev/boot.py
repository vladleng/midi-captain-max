"""
MIDI Captain boot.py

Runs once at device power-on/reset, before code.py.

CRITICAL: Autoreload is DISABLED for rock-solid live performance.
The device must NEVER reset unexpectedly during a gig. File changes
on the USB drive will not trigger reloads.

USB DRIVE — two modes, controlled by config.json:

  Performance Mode (default, dev_mode: false):
    Drive is hidden unless Switch 1 is held during boot.
    - Hold switch 1 (top-left) while powering on → USB drive appears
    - Release switch and reboot normally → USB hidden again

  Development Mode (dev_mode: true):
    Drive always mounts on boot — no switch needed.
    Convenient when iterating on firmware locally.

To reload after config/code changes:
- Send Ctrl+D over serial console
- Or power-cycle the device
