# MIDI Captain MAX — Firmware Installation

## Getting Started

1. **Connect** your MIDI Captain to your computer via USB
2. A drive called **CIRCUITPY** or **MIDICAPTAIN** should appear

> **Don't see the drive?** See the [Recovery](#recovery) section below.

## Install with the Deploy Script (Recommended)

The deploy script is the easiest way to install or update firmware. It automatically detects your device, installs required libraries, and preserves your settings.

### macOS / Linux

Open a terminal in this folder and run:

```bash
# First-time install (downloads required libraries)
./deploy.sh --install

# Update existing firmware
./deploy.sh
```

**Options:**

| Flag | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `--install` | Full install including CircuitPython libraries |
| `--eject` | Safely eject the device after deploying |
| `--fresh` | Reset config.json to factory defaults |
| `--libs-only` | Only install/update CircuitPython libraries |

### Windows (PowerShell)

Open PowerShell in this folder and run:

```powershell
# First-time install (downloads required libraries)
.\deploy.ps1 -Install

# Update existing firmware
.\deploy.ps1
```

**Options:**

| Flag | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `-Install` | Full install including CircuitPython libraries |
| `-Eject` | Safely eject the device after deploying |
| `-Fresh` | Reset config.json to factory defaults |
| `-LibsOnly` | Only install/update CircuitPython libraries |
| `-MountPoint E:\` | Use a specific drive letter |

> **Both scripts** auto-detect your device type (STD10 or Mini6) and preserve your existing button mappings, colors, and other settings.

## Manual Installation

Use this method if the deploy scripts aren't working for you.

1. **Connect** your MIDI Captain via USB
2. **Hold Button 1** (top-left footswitch) while powering on — this enables write access
3. **Copy ALL files and folders** from this package to the device drive, replacing existing files
4. The device **restarts automatically** when the copy finishes. If it doesn't, unplug and replug the USB cable.

> **Important:** If you've already customized your `config.json` (button mappings, colors, etc.), **don't overwrite it** — skip that file when copying.

## Recovery

If your device ends up in a bad state, don't worry — it's fully recoverable:

1. Connect the device via USB (it should still show up as a drive)
2. Delete everything on the drive
3. Copy the firmware files onto the drive again
4. The device will restart with a clean install

If the drive doesn't appear at all, reinstall CircuitPython:

1. **Hold Switch 1** (top-left footswitch) while plugging in USB — a drive called **RPI-RP2** will appear
2. Download the CircuitPython 7.x `.uf2` file for your board
3. Copy the `.uf2` file to the RPI-RP2 drive
4. The device will reboot and appear as **CIRCUITPY**
5. Now copy the firmware files (or run the deploy script)
