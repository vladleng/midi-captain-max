## Project Context

This repository creates **custom CircuitPython firmware** for Paint Audio MIDI Captain foot controllers — a **generic, config-driven, bidirectional MIDI firmware** suitable for diverse performance scenarios.

### Primary Goals
- **Bidirectional MIDI sync** — host controls LEDs/LCD state, device sends switch/encoder events
- **Config-driven mapping** — JSON configuration for MIDI assignments and UI layouts
- **Multi-device support** — STD10 (10-switch) and Mini6 (6-switch) primary targets
- **Hybrid state model** — local toggle for instant feedback, host-authoritative when it speaks
- **Clean architecture** — device abstraction layer, separation of concerns, testable components
- **Rock-solid reliability** — NO unexpected resets during live performance; stability is paramount

### Target Users
- Musicians controlling DAWs, plugin hosts (MainStage, Gig Performer), multi-effect units, synthesizers, and any other MIDI-controllable device
- Power users who want configurable button-to-CC/PC/Note mappings
- Anyone needing visual feedback (LEDs, LCD) reflecting host state
- **Live performers** who demand bulletproof reliability on stage

### Reliability Philosophy

This is a **live performance tool**. The device must:
- **Never reset unexpectedly** — autoreload is disabled; changes require explicit reload
- **Never crash** — defensive coding, graceful error handling, no unhandled exceptions
- **Never lose state** — if host connection drops, device continues functioning locally
- **Never surprise the performer** — predictable behavior in all scenarios

## Design Decisions (from Brainstorming)

These decisions were made during the 2026-01-23 brainstorming session:

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Source of truth** | Hybrid | Local state for instant feedback, host overrides when it speaks |
| **MIDI types** | CC + PC + SysEx + Notes | Full protocol support; Notes enable tuner display |
| **Display MVP** | Button label slots | Each switch gets a labeled area; center status area later |
| **Config format** | JSON | Standard, predictable, web-tool-friendly (originally planned YAML, shipped JSON) |
| **Architecture** | Polling loop | Polling-based main loop (asyncio unavailable in CP 7.x) |
| **Button modes** | All | Momentary, toggle, long-press, double-tap, tap tempo (phased rollout) |

### Feature Priority (MVP)

| Priority | Feature | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Bidirectional CC (host → device LED sync) | ✅ Working |
| 2 | Button label slots on screen | ✅ Working |
| 3 | JSON config for button→MIDI mappings | ✅ Working |
| 4 | Momentary + Toggle modes per button | ✅ Working |
| 5 | Multi-device support (STD10 + Mini6) | ✅ Working |
| 6 | SysEx for dynamic labels/colors | Post-MVP |
| 7 | Long-press detection | Post-MVP |
| 8 | Center status area | Post-MVP |

## Prior Art & Reference Implementations

### Paint Audio OEM SuperMode Firmware
- **Docs**: `docs/FW-SuperMode-4.0-BriefGuide.txt`, `docs/Super_Mode_V1.2.en.pdf`
- **Strengths**: Keytimes (multi-press cycling), 99 pages, 3-segment LED control, HID keyboard
- **Weaknesses**: No bidirectional MIDI: device can't respond to host state changes

### Helmut Keller's Firmware
- **Code**: `firmware/original_helmut/code.py`
- **Docs**: `docs/a midi foot controller...pdf`, `docs/GLOBAL RACKSPACE Script...gpscript`
- **Strengths**: Bidirectional CC/SysEx, tuner mode, clean asyncio architecture
- **Weaknesses**: Hardcoded to Helmut's workflow, fixed CC mapping, STD10-only

### PySwitch (Tunetown)
- **Repo**: https://github.com/Tunetown/PySwitch
- **Strengths**: Action/callback architecture, web config tool, multi-device support
- **Weaknesses**: Complex architecture, heavily Kemper-focused, Python config (not YAML)

## Code Attribution & Directory Structure

### ⚠️ Original Code Preservation
All code in `firmware/original_helmut/` is authored by **Helmut Keller** and must remain **untouched** with full attribution. This serves as the pristine reference baseline.

### Development Philosophy
**Helmut's code was a starting point, not a constraint.** We are free to completely refactor, redesign, or rewrite any functionality. There is no requirement to stay close to his architecture, naming conventions, or approach. Build what makes sense for this project. It will likely have very little resemblance to Helmut's original code. However we are very thankful and appreciative for his work!

### Directory Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `firmware/original_helmut/` | Helmut Keller's original firmware — **DO NOT MODIFY** |
| `firmware/dev/` | Active development — refactored code goes here |
| `firmware/dev/devices/` | Device abstraction modules (std10.py, mini6.py) |
| `firmware/dev/experiments/` | Throwaway experiments and proof-of-concepts |
| `firmware/dev/core/` | Core modules (button.py, config.py, colors.py) |
| `firmware/dev/fonts/` | PCF display fonts (PTSans variants) |
| `firmware/dev/lib/` | CircuitPython libraries (CP 7.x `.mpy` format, from bundle `20230718`) |
| `config-editor/` | Config editor app (Tauri + SvelteKit) |
| `tests/` | pytest test suite with CircuitPython hardware mocks |
| `tests/mocks/` | Mock modules for board, digitalio, neopixel, etc. |
| `docs/` | Architecture notes, MIDI protocol docs, hardware findings |
| `docs/plans/` | Design documents and implementation plans |
| `tools/` | Helper scripts (packaging, validation, deployment) |

### New Code Guidelines
- All new code belongs in `firmware/dev/` or new directories (never in `original_helmut/`)
- Include clear module docstrings with author and date
- Reference original Helmut code when functionality is derived from it

---

## Development Practices

### Git Workflow
- **Trunk-based development** — work on `main`, use short-lived feature branches if needed
- Commit frequently with clear, descriptive messages
- Use terminal commands (`git status`, `git log`, etc.) as source of truth

### Versioning
- **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** with pre-release tags
- Use GitHub Releases for tagged versions
- Tag format: `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}[-{prerelease}.{n}]`
- **Runtime version**: `code.py` reads from a `VERSION` file (not hardcoded). The file is generated by `git describe --tags --always` during build/deploy. Falls back to `"dev"` if the file is missing.
- `VERSION` is written by all 3 distribution paths: `deploy.sh`, `ci.yml`, and `build-gumroad-zip.sh`
- `firmware/dev/VERSION` is gitignored (generated artifact)

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- **CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Runs on push/PR to any branch
  - Lints code with Ruff (ignores E501, F401, E402 for CircuitPython compatibility)
  - Validates Python syntax
  - Writes `VERSION` file into firmware zip from git tag/describe
  - Runs pytest suite (`tests/`)
  - Uses `requirements-dev.txt` for dependencies
- **Release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): Triggered by version tags
  - Packages `firmware/dev/` into a zip (excludes `experiments/`, `__pycache__/`)
  - Creates GitHub Release with artifacts
  - Auto-detects alpha/beta for pre-release flag

To create a release:
```bash
git tag v1.0.0-alpha.1
git push origin v1.0.0-alpha.1
```

### Dependencies
- **`requirements-dev.txt`**: CI/dev tools (ruff, pytest)
- **`requirements-circuitpython.txt`**: On-device libraries for `circup install -r`

### Configuration
- **JSON** for user-facing configuration (MIDI mappings, layouts, device settings)
- Keep config schema documented and validated
- Config editor app in `config-editor/` (Tauri + SvelteKit)

## CircuitPython Practices

This project uses CircuitPython firmware deployed to hardware devices (Mini6, MCM, STD10). Always verify changes work with the target hardware constraints. For mpy-cross, use Adafruit's CircuitPython builds, NOT MicroPython pip packages.

- Target **CircuitPython 7.x** (7.3.1 verified on devices)
- Board identifies as `raspberry_pi_pico` (RP2040 MCU)
- USB CDC disconnects on reset — use auto-reconnect serial workflows
- `boot.py` uses GP1 as a mode pin; readable at boot, usable as switch afterward
- Autoreload typically disabled for performance; enable temporarily for rapid iteration

### Version Compatibility Notes

| Feature | CP 7.x | CP 8.x+ |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Disable autoreload | `supervisor.disable_autoreload()` | `supervisor.runtime.autoreload = False` |

**TODO**: When upgrading to CircuitPython 8.x+, update `boot.py` to use `supervisor.runtime.autoreload = False` instead of `supervisor.disable_autoreload()`.

### CP 7.x Syntax Restrictions (CRITICAL)

CircuitPython 7.3.1 does NOT support all CPython syntax. These features pass `py_compile` and `pytest` on desktop Python but **crash on device boot** with `SyntaxError`:

| Banned Construct | Example | Use Instead |
|------------------|---------|-------------|
| Dict unpacking in literals | `{**cfg, "key": val}` | Manual loop: `for k,v in d.items(): r[k] = v` |
| Walrus operator | `if (n := len(x)) > 0:` | Separate assignment |
| `match`/`case` | `match x: case 1:` | `if`/`elif` |

**CI enforces this** via the "CircuitPython 7.x compatibility guard" step in `ci.yml`. It greps `firmware/dev/` for banned patterns and fails the build.

**Barrel imports are dangerous on embedded.** Keep `__init__.py` files minimal (no re-exports). If `__init__.py` imports a submodule, CircuitPython parses the entire submodule eagerly — a single syntax error in any submodule prevents the whole package from importing.

## Hardware Reference

Hardware pin mappings are documented in [docs/hardware-reference.md](docs/hardware-reference.md).
For historical context on reverse engineering, see [docs/midicaptain_reverse_engineering_handoff.md](docs/midicaptain_reverse_engineering_handoff.md).

### STD10 (10-switch)
- 30 NeoPixels (10 switches × 3 LEDs) on GP7
- 11 switch inputs (10 footswitches + encoder push)
- Rotary encoder on GP2/GP3
- Expression pedal inputs on A1/A2
- ST7789 240×240 display

### Mini6 (6-switch)
- 18 NeoPixels (6 switches × 3 LEDs) on GP7
- 6 switch inputs including unusual pins (`board.LED`, `board.VBUS_SENSE`)
- ST7789 240×240 display (same params as STD10)
- No encoder or expression inputs

### Device Auto-Detection
Two-tier detection (config first, then hardware probe):
1. **Config-based**: reads `"device"` field from `/config.json` (`"mini6"` or `"std10"`)
2. **Hardware probe fallback**: checks STD10-exclusive switch pins (GP0/GP18/GP19/GP20) — if 3+ read HIGH with pull-ups, it's STD10; otherwise Mini6

**Note**: The old approach (probing `board.LED`/`board.VBUS_SENSE` for Mini6) was broken — GP25 exists on both devices, so everything was detected as Mini6. Always include `"device"` in config.json.

### Device Abstraction
Device-specific constants live in `firmware/dev/devices/`:
- `std10.py` — STD10 pin definitions and counts ✅
- `mini6.py` — Mini6 pin definitions ✅

## Testing Strategy

### On-Device Testing
- Copy code to MIDICAPTAIN volume, observe behavior via serial console
- Use `screen` with auto-reconnect loop for serial monitoring. See docs/screen-cheatsheet.md for usage tips.
- Experiments in `firmware/dev/experiments/` for isolated testing

### Deployment

Use `tools/deploy.sh` for dev deploys (handles ordering, sync, and device detection).

All 3 distribution paths must include the same set of files and write the `VERSION` file. If you add a new directory under `firmware/dev/`, you must add it to **all** of these:
1. `tools/deploy.sh` — dev deploy via rsync (also writes `VERSION` to device and local `firmware/dev/`)
2. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — firmware zip (`build-zip` job, writes `VERSION` from lint job output)
3. `tools/build-gumroad-zip.sh` — Gumroad distribution (writes `VERSION` via `git describe`)

```bash
./tools/deploy.sh                   # Quick deploy (auto-detects mount point)
./tools/deploy.sh --install          # Full install with CircuitPython libraries
./tools/deploy.sh --eject            # Deploy + eject (forces clean reload)
./tools/deploy.sh /Volumes/MIDICAPT  # Custom mount point
```

### Desktop Testing
- **pytest** with CircuitPython hardware mocks in `tests/mocks/`
- Mocks cover: `board`, `digitalio`, `neopixel`, `displayio`, `busio`, `rotaryio`, `analogio`, `usb_midi`, `terminalio`
- Tests: `test_button_state.py`, `test_config.py`, `test_colors.py`, `test_neopixel_mock.py`, `test_switch_mock.py`
- Run: `pytest` from project root

## Communication Style

- Be concise and technical
- Prefer working code over lengthy explanations
- When proposing changes, provide complete, runnable implementations
- Document decisions and trade-offs in commit messages or docs

## Pull Request Guidelines

- When making a PR, include a clear description of the change, the rationale, and any relevant context
- Reference related issues or design docs
- Ensure all CI checks pass before requesting review
- Reviewers should focus on correctness, readability, and maintainability
- Once a PR Title and description are fully filled out, don't change them — they serve as the source of truth for the change history and rationale. If you need to clarify or update information, add notes or comments to the existing description rather than rewriting it. This preserves the original context and decision-making process for future reference.
- Do not include details on changes made during iteration in the PR description. The description should reflect the final state of the code after all iterations, not the process of getting there. This keeps the change history clean and focused on the end result rather than the development process. That being said, any important discoveries or decisions made during iteration that are relevant to understanding the final code should be documented in the PR description or in linked design docs, but not as a step-by-step account of the iteration process.

### Pull Request Examples
- Read the file docs/PR_Examples/example1.md for an example of a well-structured PR description that provides clear context, rationale, and references to design documents. This style should be followed for all PRs to ensure clarity and maintainability of the project history.
